If you haven’t figured it out, my name is Patrick Henson.

Professionally, I’m a software engineer focussed on developing clean, reusable code that meets requirements and deadlines. On a more personal side, I attempt to juggle multiple hobbies, projects, and interests while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Welcome to my personal site, tied directly to my public GitHub repositories, where I post information regarding a variety of projects. Stay tuned for more!
