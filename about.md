If you haven’t figured it out, my name is Patrick Henson.

Professionally, I’m a software manager focussed on supporting fast-moving and talented teams to deliver clean, reusable code that meets requirements and deadlines.  The driving goal for my career is that I seek to "build something that matters" where I can take pride in the purpose and impact of the projects I contribute to.

My favorite, and often used, career quotes are:

* "I'm helping" - Ralph Wiggum, The Simpsons

* "I have people skills, dammit" - Tom, Office Space

On a more personal side, I attempt to juggle multiple hobbies, projects, and interests while maintaining a healthy work-life balance. Welcome to my personal site, tied directly to my public GitHub repositories, where I post information regarding a variety of projects. Stay tuned for more!
