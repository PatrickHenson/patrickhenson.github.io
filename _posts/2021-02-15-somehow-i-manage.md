Other than the obvious reference to Michael Scott's book in The Office...I've officially been in a management roll for just over a year and it's been good, hectic, stressful, frustrating, rewarding...pick three on any given day.  


There are (many) times where I feel like my life consists of meetings and I wish I could put my head down and code.  I can say that my contribution within a team has changed in ways that I did not expect while pushing me to further develop my technical and interpersonal skillsets.  In our recurring discussions, my boss has listened to my thoughts, worked through problems, and given me a lot of good advice.  One that stuck out was a method he called the "trust triangle" (I'm sure it's in my notes somewhere...).  A quick online search presents several different interpretations, but his fit especially well within software engineering.  Below is my interpretation of how I'm approaching and using this method.

**The Trust Triangle**



* How can I prove myself and grow my career?

* How can I assess and grow the people on my team?

                                    Responsibility
                                         / \
                                        /   \
                                       /     \
                                      /       \
                                     /         \
                                    /           \
                                   /    Trust    \
                                  /               \
                                 /                 \
                                /                   \
                                — — — — — — — — — — — 
                        Communication            Reliability
                           

What are the qualities that make a person trust worthy?  Does it really differ from personal to professional relationships?
