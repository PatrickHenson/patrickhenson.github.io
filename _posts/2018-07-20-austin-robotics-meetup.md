Beer, robots, friendly faces, etc.  Seems to be a recurring theme!

Hosted at UT's Cockrell School of Engineering, this month included a discussion on the use of GraphQL and a Cassandra (NoSQL) database to allow for fast insertions of data.  The argument is that when working with a large number of robots collecting and sending data and a limited number of users, the method of storage should be focussed on fast writes rather than optimized search/read.  I've also seen Google's Protocol Buffers used to optimize passing and storing data sets, but I'm not sure how that compares in this use case.  Guess I have some light reading to do.
