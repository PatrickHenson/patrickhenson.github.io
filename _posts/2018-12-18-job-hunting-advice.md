# Resume



# Applying to jobs

## Job search

There are many tools available to help find open positions.

* Company website

If there's a company you're interested in, the best place to look is often the career section on their website.  

* Indeed

Indeed has been the best in my experience for finding opening positions that match my interests and skill set.  The easy apply feature allows you to quickly submit an application, however, many companies still require applying directly through their website or an online portal.

* LinkedIn:

I've found several opening positions on LinkedIn that led to interviews and offers.  They have searchable job post section and 'recommended' posts, which often didn't align with the region I was looking or type of position.  However, you do have the benefit of being able to look into people that work for the company and can often see who posted the position.

* Others:

Dice, Monster, etc. In my experience they tend to have a high volume of third party postings, staffing agencies, etc and little that I'm actually interested in pursuing.

## Recruiters

Types of recruiters:

* Internal: Work directly for the company to find new employees to fill job openings, often affiliated with HR.  These recruiters represent the company and are often your point of contact for scheduling interviews, sending communication, etc.

* Contingency: The recruiter gets payed when a candidate they present is hired.  Ideally they have your best interests in mind, have insight into the company, and maintain responsive communications throughout the process.  I have worked with a few that introduced me to interesting companies and lined up interviews, however, most seem to specialize in spamming your inbox with jobs that completely ignore your stated interests or skill set.

* Retained: The recruiter is hired by the company to fill a specific position, generally for companies with difficult positions to fill (senior level or specialized background) or companies that need to fill a number of positions, but don't have an internal recruiter.


# LinkedIn

Your LinkedIn profile should be a reflection of your resume with the benefit that you're not limited by page length.  This ensures that all of your experience can be listed in detail.

Tips:

* Update the region to reflect where you are looking for positions

* List skills relevant to your career and others in your network can 'vouch' for you.

# Personal Website

Having a personal website is not required and in many cases, not necessary.  However, it does allow you to create a personal brand and control how your present yourself.  This is useful if you have publications, media content, presented at conferences or seminars, and other content that doesn't fit on your resume or LinkedIn profile.

# The Interview

## Preparing for the interview

## Being nervous/anxious/stressed/etc

Determining what you're worth is a challenge since you're attempting to place a dollar value on your labor.
