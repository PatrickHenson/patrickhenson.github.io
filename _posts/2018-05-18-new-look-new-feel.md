Welcome to the new patrickhenson.com!

After ~10 years of hosting a WordPress site, it's time for a clean start.  Enter Jekyll and GitHub pages.  I'll have more control over the content and easier source control.  It's a bit sparse at the moment, but I've chosen to focus on generating new content rather than migrating the old.
