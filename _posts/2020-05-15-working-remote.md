Home sweet home...also my professional workplace.

As the medical community continues to respond to Covid-19, businesses are assessing what the "new normal" will be as offices begin to open up.  Not only do workplaces need to follow the appropriate medical guidelines defining when it is safe for employees to begin to return, they also need to plan for access control, occupancy, distancing, cleaning, etc.  Of interest is how teams working fully remote will begin to filter back into the office.

More broadly, we are experiencing an interesting change in the social dynamic that drives our workplaces.  "Ass in seat" has never been a successful metric for the quality of work an engineer delivers and managers are seeing teams adapt and thrive with virtual collaboration tools.  Software engineering is famous for striving to provide "flexibility," "lax dress code," and "focus on performance."

My team was already collaborating across multiple sites, regions, and timezones and switching from the office to working remote has had minimal impact since we already relied upon a range of collaboration tools.  Obviously access to specialized hardware, lab stations, and controlled systems requires a physical presence.  Fortunately we have been able to coordinate amongst the team to ensure that critical systems are active and available.

Unfortunately, there are teams that have struggled to adapt and now is a great time to provide insight on what collaboration tools were tested, what worked, and what needs improvement.  The fact that "video chat bingo" exists is equally entertaining and depressing.  My contact information is accessible and I do not mind providing my own insight.
