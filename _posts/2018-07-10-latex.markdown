I was recently discussing my resume with one of my good friends and he mentioned how he used LaTeX for formatting.  It was a pretty easy sell over fighting with word processors to maintain alignment and spacing every time I make a small update.  I also decided that it'd be a lot easier to keep track of different versions of my resume by giving it it's own [repository](https://github.com/PatrickHenson/resume).  It's nothing fancy and I haven't mastered LaTeX's ability to display complex regions and equations, but I'm off to a solid start.
