I have several projects coming up and finally decided to upgrade from a cheap soldering iron to a proper temperature controlled unit.  I read way too many reviews, watched comparison videos on youtube, and finally settled on the [Hakko FX-888](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888-FX-888-Soldering-Station/dp/B004M3U0VU).  We'll see how it handles!

--UPDATE--

I have use the soldering station on a few projects and would highly recommend it.  The temperature holds extremely well, the layout of controls allow for easy adjustment (configuration requires refering to the manual), the iron holder was safe/secure, and I was able to create clean joints.
