I live in front of my computers and my home office is setup with three displays.  The difference in heat emitted by the two older LCD monitors is significantly higher than my LED monitor and creates a pocket of warm air over my desk after a short amount of time.  Most often people think of advances in technology involving faster processors, better graphics, and thinner phones (just give me a bigger battery, I don't care about thickness).  However, a significant portion of the industry is dedicated to reducing power consumption, reducing heat production, and increasing durability and longevity.  Just something to think about as I search for a fan.
