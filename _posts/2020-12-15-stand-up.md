With working from home being the new norm, I made a small upgrade to my home office.  

I previously had a sit/stand desk at a prior workplace and being able to change positions through the day has a significant impact on comfort.  Now that I'm cooped up in my basement, I've prioritized proper ergonomics to maintain comfort and productivity.  

My current home office setup:

* Custom 60"x30" work surface I built from Red Oak with a semi-gloss finish.
* [DESK.HAUS Zennith Electronic Desk Frame](https://desk.haus/products/markatos-t-leg-two-motor-30) with programmable heights.
* [VIVO PC Mount](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DWKHWPB/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for my personal desktop.
* [VIVO Triple Monitor Mount](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B009S7ALH8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that's still going strong after several years.
* Micca Speakers wired to a dedicated AMP.
* [AXTRA Power Strip](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KSLQ9GS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) mounted to the underside of the desk.
* Keyboard - I tend to alternate between my 60% boards (Vortex POK3R and [custom DZ60 build](https://patrickhenson.com/2018/07/26/mechanical-keyboard.html))
* Mouse - SteelSeries Rival 700
* Switches - Ethernet switch and Keyboard/Mouse control to switch between my laptop dock and desktop.
* Laptop riser made from mahogony and pine scraps in my workshop
* Miscellaneous office supplies, cables, etc

If you're looking for a standing desk, I highly recommend [desk.haus](https://desk.haus).  I have no affiliation other than being extremely pleased with the product and customer service provided by Chris.
