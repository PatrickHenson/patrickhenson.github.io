I have several projects coming up and finally decided to upgrade from a cheap soldering iron to a proper temperature controlled unit.  I read way too many reviews, watched comparison videos on youtube, and finally settled on the [Hakko FX-888](https://www.amazon.com/Hakko-FX888-FX-888-Soldering-Station/dp/B004M3U0VU).  We'll see how it handles!
