With working from home being the norm for 2020 and beyond, I made a simple upgrade to my home office as my holiday-gift-to-me.  The ability to stand up.  

I previously had a sit/stand desk at a prior workplace and being able to change positions through the day was nice.  Now that I'm cooped up in my basement, proper ergonomics has been a priority to maintain comfort and productivity.  I built a custom red oak 60"x30" work surface and mounted it on an electronic sit/stand desk frame capable of supporting all of my equipment (up to 350lb).

If you're looking for a standing desk, I highly recommend [desk.haus](https://desk.haus).  I have no affiliation other than being extremely pleased with the product and customer service provided by Chris.
