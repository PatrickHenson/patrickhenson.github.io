With working from home being the norm for 2020 and beyond, I made a simple upgrade to my home office as my holiday-gift-to-me.  The ability to stand up.  

I previously had a sit/stand desk at a prior workplace and being able to change positions through the day was nice.  Now that I'm cooped up in my basement, proper ergonomics has been a priority to maintain comfort and productivity.
