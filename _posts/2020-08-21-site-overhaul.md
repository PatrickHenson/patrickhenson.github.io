The latest change is the addiition of category links in the site header.  This improves navigation and allows all related posts to be displayed on a single page.  To support this, a significant portion of the site had minor edits to fit the new format and provide necessary metadata.


[This blog](http://longqian.me/2017/02/09/github-jekyll-tag/) wound up being the easiest way to implement using Jekyll even though it does require the creation of a file placeholder per tag.  This is due to Jekyll being static and not having a convenient mechanism for passing variables into a page.  I did investigate how includes can be passed variables, but that doesn't work cleanly with template/page content.
