One thing that's been in the back of my mind is "how to stay on top of my career?"  More importantly, what should I be doing or could be doing better?

Currently I peruse reddit, listen to podcasts, pickup books, follow a few blogs, attend local meetups, and read articles from [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com).  There are thousands of resources available and the internet has made many of them extremely accessible.  It's also impossible to keep up with everything as technology and its applications are constantly changing.

Podcasts:
* [Coding Blocks](https://www.codingblocks.net/)
* [Embedded.fm](https://www.embedded.fm/)
* [Software Engineering Daily](https://softwareengineeringdaily.com/)

Books (a few that are easy to recommend as a starting point):
* Clean Coder
* The Pragmatic Programmer
* The Mythical Man Month
* Code Complete
* ...

However, I personally find the best way to learn is through hands on experimentation in personal projects or at work.  Coming home to study/read/code can feel exhausting and is an area that I'm working to set aside time and focus.  One thing that has helped is keeping a list of project ideas for future pursuit.  Minimally, it allows me to think through how I would architect and implement the project which is a form of practice on its own.

One pet peeve of mine is 'studying' for interviews.  The concepts are important, but it can feel as though dusting off and rehashing topics unrelated to the skills necessary to perform the job.  Interviewing is almost an art of its own as there are challenges in assessing skills without credentialing.

Interview Resources:
* Cracking the Coding Interview
* The Imposter's Handbook (haven't read it, but it's been mentioned on Coding Blocks)
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)
* [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/)
* [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/)
