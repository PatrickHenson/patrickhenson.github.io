I recently worked on a project which required the use of several dials to display hardware feedback to the user.  However, many of the dial packages available didn't meet the project's needs, required a quote/licensing process that didn't fit the timeline, or were open sourced under more prohibitive licenses.

Fortunately, I received the necessary approval to provide my own version to the community.

The goal of this project is to provide a programatically generated dial that is easily customizable for use in any project.  It is developed in C++/Qt to allow for cross platform compatibility and is released as open source under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) to allow for incorporation into open and closed source projects.

I just finished developing the base DialWidget.  When I have time I will expand its functionality, provide several sample classes expanding upon the DialWidget, take screenshots, and update the demo application.  Look for updates in the near future!
