Are you developing a C++/Qt GUI and need to display data using analog dials?

I recently worked on a project that required the use of several dials to display hardware feedback to the user. However, many of the dial packages available didn't meet the requirements, had a quote/licensing process that didn't fit the timeline, or were released under more prohibitive licenses. Fortunately, I secured the necessary permissions to release my own version to the open source community.

This project provides a easily customizable, programmatically generated dial widget.  It is developed in C++/Qt to allow for cross platform compatibility and is released as open source under the [Apache 2.0 License](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) to allow for incorporation into open and closed source projects.
