I'm working my way through Embedded Systems Security with a study group and so far it's been excellent.  

Coincidentally, NPR's All Things Considered included a segment discussing our vulnerability to cyber attacks on my commute home today.  During the piece the author made a few points that stuck with me.  Even though the National Intelligence Threat Assessment has ranked cyberthreats as our biggest threat, his largest fear is that it will take a large scale attack to prompt resources being dedicated to better security.  In the meantime, since cyber warfare is not treated as an act of war, those implementing the attacks are given wide leeway without serious consequence.
